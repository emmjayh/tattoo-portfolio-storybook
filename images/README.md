# Images Folder - Auto-Loading Portfolio

## ðŸš€ SUPER EASY: Just Drop Images Here!

### How to add images:

1. **Name your images with this format:**
   - `1_Dragon_Sleeve.jpg` 
   - `2_Phoenix_Back_Piece.png`
   - `3_Geometric_Wolf.jpg`
   - `10_Watercolor_Rose.jpg`
   - `100_Custom_Design.png`

2. **Drop them in this folder** - That's it! They automatically appear in your portfolio.

### Naming Rules:
- Start with a number and underscore: `1_`, `2_`, `99_`, etc.
- The number controls the order (1 appears before 2, etc.)
- Use underscores instead of spaces: `Dragon_Sleeve` not `Dragon Sleeve`
- The number prefix is removed on the website (shows as "Dragon Sleeve")

### Examples:
- File: `1_Dragon_Sleeve.jpg` â†’ Shows as: "Dragon Sleeve"
- File: `25_Geometric_Wolf.png` â†’ Shows as: "Geometric Wolf"
- File: `100_My_Best_Work.jpg` â†’ Shows as: "My Best Work"

### Supported formats:
- JPG/JPEG
- PNG
- GIF
- WEBP

### Tips:
- Keep images under 2MB for fast loading
- Use descriptive names (they become the titles)
- Number them in the order you want them to appear
- You can add thousands of images - the system handles it all automatically!

### No HTML editing needed! 
Just drop your images here and restart the server. The website automatically:
- Creates a page for each image
- Uses the filename as the title (minus the number prefix)
- Sorts them by number
- Handles pagination in the book format
